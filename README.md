# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Cezar KItchen is a high school cafeteria that serve students and staff in UWC ISAK Japan. The cafeteria is managed by a Dariosan and has a student representative named Thumula Ayodhya Karunaratne. Until recently there was a notebook near the exit where you could write feedback about the lunch that you just eat, but because people where using it just to spam two things (karage and apple crumble), therefore the notebook was removed. One day Thumula had the idea to create a device that could take feedback at the exit like the ones after the security check in airports. Because the number of dishes could change it was opted for a numerical feedback system. Also to have a more specific feedback, the device should have a screen where the user could write a comment. The device should also have a login system for the management to see the feedback and the comments. 

## Succes Criteria

1. Working Fast Feedback System
2. Working Additional Feedback System (add/edit/delete)
3. Enjoyable User Experience (The program will be built using a Material Design framework and employ a unfied color theme)

## Design Statement 

Looking at the clients requirements the best solution for this feedback system would be a tablet with a set of buttons to allow the user to add a quick one-click feedback and a second button to allows to a more dish specific feedback. Because Dariosan usually dosen't uses his computer oftenly it would be better to make the feedback availeble for review dirrectly on the feedback screen.

For the back end management we decided to use python because it is a language that I am familiar with and it is easy to use, and because this is a small project performance is not a big issue.
For the GUI design we decided that using kivy would be the best option because I already had some experience with it and it would be easy to implement with the database because it a framework that uses python. Even if flutter would be a better option at every aspect [^2], it would be too much work to learn it in such a short time for this kind of short project. I used the add-on library KivyMD to make it easier to implement and edit.

## List of techniques used

1. 

## Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition

In computational thinking, decomposition refers to breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive,
understand, program, and maintain.

#### Pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction



#### Algorithms



## Development

#### OOP

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

In order to validate our concept of creation, we created a MVP as a prototype to make sure our concept is reliable and
achievable.
